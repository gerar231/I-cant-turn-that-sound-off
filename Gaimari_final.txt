“I can't turn that sound off” exhibits a diverse portfolio of amplitude, rhythm and spectral textures in it’s composition. 
The essence brings forth a rich variety of techniques in digital signal processing to manipulate human voices and develop 
a narrative contextualized in recording, programming and understanding the nuances of digital signal processing as applied
to a musical context.

Noteworthy Influences: [Context]

John Oswald - Bell Speeds: layering and looping of recordings to create brassage effect.
Jonty Harrison - Unsound Objects: enveloped filtering and narrative composition.
Joseph Anderson - Mpingo: vocal interludes and rapid progression in amplitude.
Jean-Claude Risset - Sud: extensive use of dynamic and complementary combing filters.
Paul Lansky - Six Fantasies: vocal manipulation with reverb and distortion.

Techniques:

- Looping & Time Segment Processing
- Asynchronous and Synchronous Granular Synthesis (synthesis and re-sampling)
- Finite Impulse Reponse (FIR) Filtering
- Second order Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) Filtering
- Comb FIR Filtering
- Stereo Imaging Techniques (w/ applications of combing algorithms & panning)
- Tremolo and Vibrato in imaging and filtering
- Single Side Band Modulation & Filtering
- Custom Reverberation Algorithms
- Distortion Functions
